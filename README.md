# Cash-Flow-Minimizer

Aim: To minimize no. of transactions needed to settle debts among a group of certain no. of people based on a given series of transaction.

This code is based on aiming to minimize the cash flow by using a recursive approach (in the recurrence function)

It iterates to settle debts by identifying the one with the maximum credit (amount owed) and the maximum debit (amount owing) and then transferring the minimum of the two amounts between them.
